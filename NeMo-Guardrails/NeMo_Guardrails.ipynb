    "# NeMo Guardrails\n",
    "\n",
    "NeMo Guardrails is an open-source toolkit for easily adding programmable guardrails to LLM-based conversational applications. Guardrails (or “rails” for short) are specific ways of controlling the output of a large language model, such as not talking about politics, responding in a particular way to specific user requests, following a predefined dialog path, using a particular language style, extracting structured data, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is a getting started guide for Colang 2.0. It starts with a basic “Hello World” example and then goes into dialog rails, input rails, multimodal rails and other Colang 2.0 concepts like interaction loops and LLM flows. This guide does not assume any experience with Colang 1.0, and all the concepts are explained from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "NeMo Guardrails enables developers building LLM-based applications to easily add programmable guardrails between the application code and the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmable Guardrails\n",
    "Key benefits of adding programmable guardrails include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Building Trustworthy, Safe, and Secure LLM-based Applications**: you can define rails to guide and safeguard conversations; you can choose to define the behavior of your LLM-based application on specific topics and prevent it from engaging in discussions on unwanted topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Connecting models, chains, and other services securely**: you can connect an LLM to other services (a.k.a. tools) seamlessly and securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Controllable dialog**: you can steer the LLM to follow pre-defined conversational paths, allowing you to design the interaction following conversation design best practices and enforce standard operating procedures (e.g., authentication, support).\n",
